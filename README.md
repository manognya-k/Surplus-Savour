The website enables local restaurants and charities to connect, facilitating the seamless donation of surplus food. Donors, such as restaurants will specify designated time 
slots when surplus food is available for collection by nearby charities or food banks. The website provides live updates on food availability, sending notifications to 
registered charities or food banks when surplus food is ready for collection.The initiative is non-profit, aiming to minimize food wastage and provide 
free meals to those in need.
